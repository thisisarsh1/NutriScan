## How to Obtain API Keys and Credentials

## Getting Started

. **Create a `.env` file:**  
   Before running the project, you need to create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following environment variables:

  ```bash
     DJANGO_SECRET_KEY='<your_django_secret_key>'
     DJANGO_DEBUG=True
     EMAIL_HOST_USER='<your_email_host_user>'
     EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD='<your_email_host_password>'
     GOOGLE_API_KEY='<your_google_api_key>'
  ```

### Django Secret Key

To generate a new Django secret key, you can use one of the following methods:

1. **Using an Online Tool:**
   - Visit a tool like [Django Secret Key Generator](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/).
   - Generate a key and copy it.

2. **Using Python Code:**
   - Run the following Python code in your local environment:

     ```python
     from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
     print(get_random_secret_key())
     ```

   - Copy the generated key.

3. **Update Your `.env` File:**
   - Paste the copied key into your `.env` file as the `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`:

     ```env
     DJANGO_SECRET_KEY='<your_generated_secret_key>'
     ```

This key is used by Django for cryptographic signing and should be kept secure.
